# Automated-Lung-Cancer-Detection
In the present era, cancer is the leading cause of demise in both men and women worldwide, with low survival rates due to inefficient diagnostic techniques. Recently, researchers have been devising methods to improve prediction performance. In medical image processing, image enhancement can further improve prediction performance. This study aimed to improve lung cancer image quality by utilizing and employing various image enhancement methods, such as image adjustment, gamma correction, contrast stretching, thresholding, and histogram equalization methods. We will extract the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features on enhancement images, and will apply and optimize vigorous machine learning classification algorithms, such as the decision tree (DT), na√Øve Bayes, support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian, radial base function (RBF), and polynomial.We expect the result to be the proposed methodology can be very helpful to improve the lung cancer prediction for further diagnosis and prognosis by expert radiologists to decrease the mortality rate.
